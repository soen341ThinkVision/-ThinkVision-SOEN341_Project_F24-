# ThinkVision-SOEN341_Project_F24
Team ThinkVision Repository for SOEN 341 Fall 2024
Project Overview
Team ThinkVision is thrilled to start an important project to create a strong online peer assessment system designed for schools and universities. This platform will help students evaluate each other, encouraging responsibility and teamwork in their learning. It will let students give organized feedback based on specific criteria, promoting helpful criticism and support among peers. 
Key Features
1.	User Roles and Accessibilities
o	Students: As primary users, students will have the ability to create accounts, log in securely, and access the peer assessment forms. They will be able to view their assessment scores and feedback, which will help them understand their strengths and areas for improvement.
o	Instructors: Instructors will have a couple of privileges, mainly enabling them to manage student accounts, oversee peer assessments, and access a dashboard that provides an overview of class performance and engagement.
2.	Authentication
o	Login and Sign-Up Functionality: The platform will incorporate secure authentication mechanisms to protect user data such as password encryption.
3.	Peer Assessment Form
o	Students will evaluate their peers based on a well-defined set of criteria:
	Cooperation: Assessment of how well the peer collaborates with others in group tasks.
	Conceptual Contribution: Evaluation of the peer's efforts in researching and gathering relevant information to support group projects.
	Practical Contribution: Measurement of the peer's involvement in the actual writing and organization of reports and presentations.
	Work Ethic: Assessment of the peer's commitment, reliability, and dedication to the group’s success.
Technology Stack
The development of this peer assessment system will utilize a modern technology stack that facilitates both frontend and backend development:
•	Frontend: The user interface will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive experience for users.
•	Backend: The server-side logic will be implemented using Node.js with the Express framework and JavaScript, ensuring efficient handling of requests.
•	Database: Data storage will be managed using MySQL, chosen for their scalability and efficiency in handling structured data.
