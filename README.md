# ThinkVision-SOEN341_Project_F24
Team ThinkVision repository for SOEN 341 Fall 2024
This project will revolve around creation of a website for a peer assessment system.

The website will contain the following features:
- Different types of users with different accessabilites
- A login and sign up functionality
- A peer assessment form with numerical values assigned to said peer, based on a number of criteria
- Exportation of data to CSV files

Students will be able to evaluate their peers on :
- Cooperation
- Conceptual Contribution (e.g. Researching and gathering information )
- Practical Contribution (e.g  Writing of the report(s) )
- Work Ethic

The system will have "Automated Score Sharing and Anonymous Peer Feedback" and Instructor Dashboard
