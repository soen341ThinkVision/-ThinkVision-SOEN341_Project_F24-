# ThinkVision-SOEN341_Project_F24
Team ThinkVision repository for SOEN 341 Fall 2024

# Project Overview

This project focuses on the creation of a website for a peer assessment system. It will allow students to evaluate their peers based on four key dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. This system promotes accountability, gives detailed feedback to both students and instructors, and helps improve team dynamics.

The development will follow an Agile methodology, utilizing GitHub for version control, issue tracking and task management. The system will be developed over 4 sprints, with the first sprint focusing on User Authentication & Team Management.

# Key Features
The Peer Assessment System will include the following functionality:

- User Roles and Permissions: Different user roles with varied access levels (e.g., students, instructors, admins) to specific features and dashboards.
- Login and Registration: Secure login and sign-up functionality with role-based access control.
- Peer Assessment Form: A structured evaluation form that assigns numerical values based on specific criteria (e.g., cooperation, conceptual and practical contribution, and work ethic).
- Automated Score Sharing: The system will automatically compile peer assessment data and share scores with both students and instructors.
- Anonymous Feedback: Peer feedback will be anonymized to encourage honest evaluations and prevent bias or conflict.
- Data Exportation: The ability to export assessment data to CSV files for further analysis by instructors.
- Instructor Dashboard: Instructors will have access to a dashboard to view aggregated scores, individual student feedback, and team performance trends over time.
